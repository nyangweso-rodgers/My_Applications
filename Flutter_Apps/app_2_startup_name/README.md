# app_2_startup_name

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
## Use an external package
We'll be using an open - source external package named [english_words](https://pub.dev/packages/english_words) , which contains a few thousand of the most used English words plus some utility functions.

You can find the english_words package, as well as many other open source packages, on the [Pub site](https://pub.dev/flutter/packages).

The __pubspec file__ manages the assets for a __Flutter app__. In __pubspec.yaml__, append english_words: ^3.1.0 (english_words 3.1.0 or higher) to the dependencies list:

## Add a stateful widget
__Stateless widgets__ are __immutable__, meaning that their properties can't changeâ€”all values are final.
